SyntaxScope is a web-based static analysis tool focused on Tokenization and Parsingâ€”two core 
compiler components. It takes user input (C-style code), performs lexical analysis to generate tokens, 
and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using grammar rules. The tool detects errors such as invalid 
identifiers, undeclared variables, or syntax mismatches, and visually displays both token streams and 
AST. Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, this tool helps learners understand compiler internals by 
simulating how source code is transformed through lexing and parsing.

What are Tokenization and Parsing?
Breaking text into meaningful units called tokens.
